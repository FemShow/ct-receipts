# ct-receipts
This data is based on the live table that provides the latest data available on receipts of Council Taxes collected during a financial year in England. 

The information in this table is derived from Quarterly Return of Council Taxes and National Non-Domestic Rates Returns (QRC1-4) submitted to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities by English local authorities.

The quarterly information is used in the local authority components of the National Accounts compiled by the Office for National Statistics. The table is updated as soon as new or revised data becomes available. Local authority level data will be made available once a financial year is complete.
